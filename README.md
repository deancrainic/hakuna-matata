# hakuna-matata
My first full stack app developed during my Amdaris internship.

The application, named Hakuna Matata, is used for booking accommodations. Anyone with an account can add a property, with pictures stored on Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, and other people, that have an account, can reserve the property for as many nights as they need.
I did my best to implement Clean Architecture, with CQRS and Mediator(with the Mediatr library) patterns.
